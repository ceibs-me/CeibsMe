My name is Xin Liu, but I usually go by @Livid, it is my handle on the Internet since the early 2000s.

For the most part of my life so far, I am a programmer. I make websites. One of the bigger among all I created is [V2EX.com](https://www.v2ex.com/).

It is a community of developers and designers. I want to make it a great place for discussing technical topics -- those whys and hows when people are building something.

I live in Southern California. I do check my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/livid), so if you want to get in touch, please send me a DM via Twitter.
