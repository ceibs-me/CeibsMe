I"p<p>My name is Xin Liu, but I usually go by @Livid, it is my handle on the Internet since the early 2000s.</p>

<p>For the most part of my life so far, I am a programmer. I make websites. One of the bigger among all I created is <a href="https://www.v2ex.com/">V2EX.com</a>.</p>

<p>It is a community of developers and designers. I want to make it a great place for discussing technical topics â€“ those whys and hows when people are building something.</p>

<p>I live in Southern California. I do check my <a href="https://twitter.com/livid">Twitter</a>, so if you want to get in touch, please send me a DM via Twitter.</p>
