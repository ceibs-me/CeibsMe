I"Ô<p>Remember, the <strong>only thing</strong> before everything, is to have a dogma. A dogma is a list consists by DOs and DONTs. You make it, stick to it while adapt it to reality, question yourself from time to time: is everything on the list mutually exclusive and collectively exhausive?</p>

<p>And there is a meta dogma for dogmas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Avoid emotional tactics</li>
  <li>Every kindness counts</li>
  <li>Gentleness is the ultimate strength</li>
</ul>
